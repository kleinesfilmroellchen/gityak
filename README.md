# GitYak

[SerenityOS](https://serenityos.org/) and [yaksplained](https://yaksplained.org/) if you don't get the context or the joke (or both).

Dumb browser extension that yakifies GitHub, so that you're truly yakshaving.

No, I won't ever publish this extension to any store. Fuck Google, Fuck Mozilla, get the SerenityOS browser.
